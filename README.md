# üîê Auto WiFi Login for BITS Pilani

This Python script automates login to the BITS Pilani WiFi network. The network portal link (`http://192.168.1.1/`) is essentially the self IP address of the router, which automatically redirects users to the network's login page. The script handles this dynamic redirect process by extracting the required `4Tredir` parameter, sending login credentials via a POST request, and verifying internet connectivity.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üîÑ Automatically follows JavaScript redirect to extract `4Tredir`
- üì¨ Submits login form using the `requests` library
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Retries until internet connection is successful
- üîê Uses a separate `creds.py` file for storing credentials
- üìã Copies info to clipboard via `pbcopy` (optional for MacOS and Linux)

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Internet browser redirect must pass through `http://192.168.1.1/` (It redirects to login page by default)

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aaravshah2907/College-Wifi-Login.git
```

Rename the `creds.py.example` file to `creds.py` and populate it with your credentials:

```python
# creds.py
USERNAME = "your_username"
PASSWORD = "your_password"
```

Run the script:

```bash
python wifi_login.py
```

---

## üåÄ Alternative Method: Shell Script

This project also provides a shell script for quick execution. After setting up your credentials in `wifi_login.sh` on line 45 and 46, you can use the `wifi_login.sh` script to automate the login process.

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x wifi_login.sh
```

Run the script:

```bash
./wifi_login.sh
```

This method is especially useful for users who prefer a command-line approach without directly invoking Python.

**14. Click "Save"**

<p><img src="./contents/pcyja1cd.png"></p>

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Since the application is downloaded from GitHub, macOS may block it from running initially. To allow the application to run, go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General**, and click **Allow Anyway** for the blocked app. Then, try running the application again.

## ‚ùì Why the Need for This Project?

For macOS users, the default login process for the BITS Pilani WiFi network can be cumbersome. Each time the network is accessed, users are greeted with a login pop-up that requires manual input of credentials. This project eliminates the need for repetitive manual logins by automating the entire process, providing a seamless and efficient way to connect to the network.

## üéÅ Bonus: Automate macOS App on Startup and Periodically

To ensure seamless connectivity, you can configure the macOS app to run automatically at startup and every 10,000 seconds.

### Automate on Startup

1. Open the `System Settings` on your macOS.
2. Navigate to **General > Login Items**.
3. Click the `+` button under the **Open at Login** section.
4. Locate and select the `.app` file from its location (e.g., `~/Documents/Code/BITS-Wifi-Login`).
5. The app will now run automatically every time you log in to your macOS.

### Automate Every 2,000 Seconds

1. Open the `Terminal` and create a new `launchd` plist file:

   ```bash
   nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.bitswifi.autologin.plist
   ```

2. Add the following content to the file:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
   <key>Label</key>
   <string>com.bitswifi.autologin</string>
   <key>ProgramArguments</key>
   <array>
      <string>/path/to/your/Wifi-Login.app/Contents/MacOS/Automator Application Stub</string>
   </array>
   <key>StartInterval</key>
   <integer>2000</integer>
   <key>RunAtLoad</key>
   <true/>
   </dict>
   </plist>
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/app/Wifi-Login` with the actual path to the `.app` file.

3. Save and exit the file (`Ctrl+X`, `y`, `Enter`).

4. Load the plist file into `launchd`:

   ```bash
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.bitswifi.autologin.plist
   ```

The app will now run automatically every 12,000 seconds and at startup, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity.

## Automate execution of `wifi_login.sh` on Linux with systemd-timer

1. After setting up credentials in `wifi_login.sh` on line 45 and 46, as root or with sudo execute: 

    ```bash
    sudo mv wifi_login.sh /usr/local/bin/
    ```
2. Move the systemd files to their locations as root or with sudo:

    ```bash
    sudo mv systemd/wifi_login.service systemd/wifi_login.timer /etc/systemd/system/
    ```

3. Enable and Start the timer: 
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable --now wifi_login.timer
    ```
    This will start a systemd-timer which will run `wifi_login.sh` every 2000 seconds starting at boot.
4. Check status if the timer is running with:
    ```
    systemctl list-timers --all
    ```
